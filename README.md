# Go Deep Learning Inference Engine

This project aims to make trained models such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, etc., easily accessible within Go. It leverages the features of [Intel's inference engine](https://software.intel.com/en-us/deep-learning-sdk) (a part of the deep learning SDK) to interact with optimized and well-trained neural networks.

_Note_: This is a work in progress.

# Requirements

- [Go 1.8+](https://golang.org/)
- Ubuntu 14.04
- [Intel's Deep Learning SDK Deployment Tools](https://software.intel
